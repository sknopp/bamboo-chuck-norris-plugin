# Bamboo ChuckNorris-Plugin

Displays a picture of Chuck Norris and a random Chuck Norris 'The Programmer' fact on each build page.

[original idea](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chucknorris) by Baptiste Mathus for Jenkins ported to Bamboo.

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
